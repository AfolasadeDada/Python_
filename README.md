# Maji Ndogo Farming Automation: SQL and Data Analysis

This SQL notebook is part of an ambitious project to **automate farming** in Maji Ndogo, a region with diverse and challenging agricultural landscapes. The goal is to optimize farming decisions by analyzing key factors such as **rainfall, soil fertility, and climate conditions**, ensuring that technology is deployed where it will have the greatest impact.

### Project Overview:
The analysis begins with identifying the best locations and conditions for crop growth in Maji Ndogo. The dataset, stored in an SQLite database, includes various critical factors like **soil quality**, **elevation**, and **climate data**. SQL is used to retrieve and clean the data, setting the foundation for deeper exploration.

### Key Focus Areas:
- **Data Importation**: The first step involves importing data from multiple tables in the SQLite database. The data is prepared for analysis by ensuring it is clean and structured.
- **Tea Cultivation Analysis**: A detailed examination of tea cultivation, focusing on factors such as **rainfall**, **elevation**, and **soil type** to identify optimal conditions for tea plantations.
- **Soil Fertility Mapping**: Grouping data by **soil type** and **location** to pinpoint the most fertile areas for crop cultivation. This helps in recommending regions where automation can significantly improve yields.
- **Climate and Geography Correlation**: Understanding how climate factors like **elevation**, **temperature**, and **rainfall** affect crop yields. The goal is to identify the most suitable areas for deploying automated farming systems.
- **Top Crop Performer Identification**: Analyzing data to determine which crops perform best in Maji Ndogo and under what conditions. The analysis filters, groups, and sorts the data to uncover which crop offers the highest yield and the optimal conditions for its success.

### Pandas and Visualizations:
In addition to SQL queries, **Pandas** is employed for data analysis, offering a powerful way to explore and visualize the dataset. Techniques such as **bar plots**, **histograms**, and **scatter plots** help in visualizing relationships between variables and uncovering trends in the data.
