# Maji Ndogo Farming Automation: SQL and Data Analysis

Welcome back to the Maji Ndogo project! We're diving deeper into the ambitious mission to **automate farming** in Maji Ndogo, a region known for its diverse and challenging agricultural landscapes. Before we tackle how to introduce automation, we need to determine where and what to plant. This requires careful analysis of various factors like **rainfall, soil fertility, and climate** conditions to make informed decisions.

### Project Overview:
Our aim is to use **data analysis** as the foundation for optimizing farming practices in Maji Ndogo. We have a dataset that includes critical information like soil quality, elevation, climate, and geographical data. By leveraging SQL and Python, we will piece together these data points to recommend the best locations and conditions for growing specific crops.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
- **Data Importation**: The dataset is stored in an SQLite database, split across multiple tables. We’ll use SQL to retrieve, clean, and prepare this data for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: As expected, the data isn’t perfect. We’ll clean and restructure it to make it usable for our analysis.
- **Deep Dive into Tea Cultivation**: Our first focus is on **tea**, one of the key crops in Maji Ndogo. We’ll analyze the factors that influence its growth, such as **rainfall**, **elevation**, and **soil type**, to determine optimal planting areas.
  
### Key Tasks and Functions:
1. **Rainfall and Elevation Analysis for Tea**: Create a function that filters for tea plantations and returns the mean rainfall and elevation values.
2. **Soil Fertility Mapping**: Group the data by soil type and location to find the most fertile areas for future crop cultivation.
3. **Climate and Geography Correlation**: Create a function to understand how climate and geography influence crop yields. By grouping data based on geographical factors like elevation and temperature, we will gain insights into the best farming locations.
4. **Top Crop Performer Analysis**: Identify the best-performing crop in Maji Ndogo by filtering and sorting the data based on **Standard Yield**. Determine what conditions make it successful and which areas can replicate this success.

### Pandas Pro Tips:
We’ll also incorporate some powerful **Pandas** functionalities to enhance our analysis. For example:
- Quickly visualize data using `df.plot(kind='bar')` for bar plots, `df.plot(kind='hist', bins=10)` for histograms, and `df.plot(kind='scatter', x='col1', y='col2')` for scatter plots.
  
By working through this notebook, you’ll gain not only SQL experience but also practical data analysis skills that will help us make critical decisions for the future of farming in Maji Ndogo.
